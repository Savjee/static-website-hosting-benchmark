# Cloud storage performance test results

In 2017 I ran an experiment on Pingdom to see what cloud provider is the fastest to host a static website. The experiment ran for 10 days and compared these services:

* Amazon S3
* Amazon CloudFront (with S3 bucket as origin)
* Google Cloud Regional bucket
* Google Cloud Multiregion bucket
* GitHub Pages
* Netlify
* Firebase hosting

This repository contains the raw data that was exported from Pingdom. Feel free to use it to do your own analysis!

# Conclusions
My conclusions and anlysis can be read on my blog [here](https://www.savjee.be/).
